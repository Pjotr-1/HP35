# 50th anniversary of the HP35

## 1972-2022

This is variant of the HP-35 Scientific Calculator Emulator With Arduino Uno, see link [1] below.

It uses the 2.8" TFT Touch Shield for Arduino with Capacitive Touch from Adafruit (product ID: 1947), see link [2] below.

The code is rewritten and instead of creating keys on the display using the GFX library, an image of the real HP35 (however squeezed to fit the screen) is read from the SD-card.

Improvements to be done (if there is time to):
- keystroke feedback; either by vibration, audio or visually
- annoying rounding errors that are not present in the real HP35
